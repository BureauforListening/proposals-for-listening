        <p><strong>Proposal for Listening – a possible definition:</strong></p>
        <p>A generative invitation to attune to sound, silence, and resonance as a way of being and relating. A proposal for listening is not merely a suggestion but a call to engage with listening as a mode and practice of reorienting one’s perception, connection, and understanding. It can manifest as an idea, an action, or a framework, expanding how we listen and what listening makes possible in communal, artistic, and everyday contexts.</p>
        <p>Proposals for Listening is put forward due to hopeful, curious, and critical engagement with our world; they seek to affect through speculation or manifestation.</p>

            "We propose to include listening as a human right in our national constitutions. And if it proves difficult to get our politicians on board, we propose to protest by listening, and by denying listening to those who we oppose, as in the ancient play Lysistrata by Aristophanes, where Greek women denied their men sex to stop a war. We are unsure of the consequences of weaponizing listening.",

            "We propose an epic battle for listening, set in a landscape with big grass fields surrounded by snow-covered mountains. Thousands of extras holding the stand together, listening as the sun sets behind the flanks, awaiting the attack of the ignorant hordes… We propose a victory for the listeners.",

            "We propose to cover all commercial posters with a new poster asking: ‘What if I listened to you?’",
            "We propose a world museum for listening, located outside of Europe and preferably not in a city. A traveling version of the museum should also exist.",
            "We propose more blank pages in books as a gesture and reminder for listening.",

            "We propose a mission for space exploration where the primary objective is not discovery, but listening to the hum of the cosmos.",
            "We propose a comedy show where the punchlines are delivered in silence, requiring the audience to listen to body language and expression.",
            "We propose listening as activism.",
