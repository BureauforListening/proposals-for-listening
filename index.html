        <p><strong>Proposal for Listening – a possible definition:</strong></p>
        <p>A generative invitation to attune to sound, silence, and resonance as a way of being and relating. A proposal for listening is not merely a suggestion but a call to engage with listening as a mode and practice of reorienting one’s perception, connection, and understanding. It can manifest as an idea, an action, or a framework, expanding how we listen and what listening makes possible in communal, artistic, and everyday contexts.</p>
        <p>Proposals for Listening is put forward due to hopeful, curious and a critical engagement with our world; they seek to affect through speculation or manifestation.</p>
